### At a Glance ###

This is a .NET console application that demonstrates how Selenium.WebDriver can be used for automation purposes, such as downloading Pluralsigh courses.
All the application settings are stored in XML-structured PluralsaverSettings.config file and you need to edit it manually in order to set up the application for your purposes.
When ran, you're getting to choose what course you want to download from the list or just type "0" to download all the courses that you've specified in the settings file.

### Important: FIPO! ###
